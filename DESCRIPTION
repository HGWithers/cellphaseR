Description: This package provides a collection of functions to generate
    common cell cycle analysis plots using imaging data from the BioTek
    Cytation platform. This package is specifically developed using data
    from propidium-iodide (PI) staining of cells, but it presumably should
    be applicable to other staining methods that are also indicative of
    relative DNA content.
